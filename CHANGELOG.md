# 0.4.1 (Sun May 8 2022)

### New
* Update to the last crystal version (1.4.1)
* Add option -d to trigger the debugger at starting.
* New auto-completion UI
  * Allow 'tabulation' to roll over completions entries.
  * Enhance the display and avoid remaining boilerplate output.
  * Add 'escape' key to close the auto-completion and 'shift-tab' to unroll entries.
  * Permit auto-completion to work on block arguments and on `&.foo`.
  * Allow auto-completion to work inside a def (argument names are not taken in account yet)
    Take also into account the current scope, the auto-completion now proposes 'property'/'getter'.. macros as their belong to the scope of a class.
  * Add macros to auto-completion
  * Implements auto-completion on require node
  * Enable auto-completion in debugger mode

* Change the 'insert new line' shortcut: 'crtl-o' -> 'alt-enter'

### Bugs fix
* Fix bug causing pry to not exit
* Fix coloration bug with named tuple keys
* Fix bug with `+=` causing error instead of going multiline
* Fix semantics bug caused by auto-completion
* Fix remaining boilerplate output when displaying auto-completion on multiline input
* Fix auto-completion not to trigger on `if`/`while` conditions and on `def` default values
* Raise syntax error on `[1 \n ,2` rather than get stuck in multiline mode
* Allow 'ctrl-tab' to work on tty
* Remove `[]`, `[]?`, `[]=` from operators coloration, so `[] of String` is colored correctly
* Remove llvm_ext.o causing it to not build on git clone
* Fix bug with pasting expression starting by '#'

### Other
* Some little cleaning.
* Update `.ameba.yml`

# 0.3.0 (Sat Jan 8 2022)

### Commits
* Update to the last crystal-i version (1.3.0)
* Update to the last crystal-i version
* Reduce aliasing when displaying very large expressions
* Update highlighter colors
* Enhance display of auto-completions entries
* Experimental: Implement auto-completion (work on basic receiver `(\w+.)*`, but ignore the context (def vars, class/module context, ...) )
* Add shortcuts move_cursor_to_begin/move_cursor_to_end
* Doing some optimizations to reduce aliasing on very long expression
* Fix bug inserting a character before an "end" wrongly triggering auto-unindent
* Remove unused ic_prelude.cr
* Trigger correct scrolling when moving history up/down
* Trigger scrolling when cursor moves on border
* Now use crystal-i as back-end to interpret crystal. The previous work done to carry out an interpreter is still available on the `custom-interpreter` branch.

### Note
The project change his goal, it not aims to reproduce an interpreter, it aims to provide a nice interface to wrap crystal interpreter
